            <h1>Pests We Deal With</h1>
            <p><strong>Each one of these pests below creates real potential for being dangerous and potentially deadly inhabitants with us. </strong></p>
            <!-- Turn into UL  with image on each side/3 col grid at LARGER SCREEN SIZES-->
            • Cockroaches carry food-poisoning organisms on the sticky pads of their “feet” as they crawl over exposed foods and food preparing surfaces in 
restaurants, homes, and other places. 
• Fire ants can cause allergic reactions, resulting in deadly anaphylactic shock. 
• The tiny Pharaoh ant can contaminate surfaces and products. 
• Some flea species transmit the deadly plague organism. And rats, who carrying fleas, urinate and defecate indiscriminately on surfaces over which they 
travel, leaving a trail of disease-carrying organisms. When they land on food, flies vomit and defecate before they begin consumption. In portions of the 
world, flies alone contribute to over 80% of infant mortalities.
• Bee and wasp stings can result in allergic shock and death. 
• Spiders have venom which is especially dangerous to the young and old. 
• Mosquitoes transmit West Nile virus, malaria, Dengue fever, encephalitis, and flus. 
• Deer ticks transmit Lyme disease. 
• Mice harbor the deadly Hanta virus. 
• Bedbugs can spread like wildfire and can cause a plethora of allergic reactions to their multitude of bites on their host. Bed bugs have occasionally been 
found to be infected with the same organisms that cause anthrax, plague and typhus.
<p>Most every pest is a vector for some other organism. It is the circle of life. </p>
